This file is a log (in org-mode format) for all of the areas of the
application, including devops, that need refactoring attention.

1. [ ] The Query string params are just a list of pairs but it's super
   cumbersome and I think we can clean it up bit with some custom data
   types and a serializer.
2. [ ] The IdOrKey translation into the correct path string is messy
   and I'm repeating the same where functions in many different
   functions (which is bad!).
3. [ ] Hackage docs! I haven't written anything. Naughty me.
4. [ ] Make Data polymorphic over the value type for any Num (how?).
